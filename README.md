# 👋 Hi, I'm Emmanuel (aka **cybernerddd**)


💻 **Web Application Security Learner | Red Team Trainee | Ethical Hacking Enthusiast**  
🌍 Based in Accra, Ghana  
🧠 Documenting my journey into offensive security, one lab at a time

## 🚀 About Me

I'm focused on becoming highly skilled in **Web Application Penetration Testing** and **Red Team operations**.  
I spend most of my time solving labs, building tools, and writing technical notes to deeply understand how real-world attacks work.

I believe in **learning in public** — so most of what I study gets turned into notes, repos, or writeups here.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🔐 Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10 and beyond)
- 🧪 PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs
- 🎭 Authentication & Access Control vulnerabilities
- 💣 SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF
- 🧰 Building and improving Python pentesting tools
- 🧠 Understanding how attacks work at a deeper level (not just payloads)

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 🧪 [Pentest Labs Notes](https://github.com/cybernerddd/pentest-labs)
Writeups and personal notes from security labs I solve.  
Focused on understanding **why** vulnerabilities work, not just how to exploit them.

### 🐍 Python Pentesting Tools (In Progress)
Custom tools I built while learning networking and MITM attacks:
- Packet Sniffer  
- MAC Address Changer  
- ARP Spoofer
- cnr multi-tool

Refactoring them into clean CLI tools with proper documentation.
